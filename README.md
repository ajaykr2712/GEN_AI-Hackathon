# Health: Pioneering Personalized Medicine with GEN AI
Introduction
Welcome to the Health: Pioneering Personalized Medicine with GEN AI project. This project aims to develop a GEN AI-powered platform that integrates genomic data, electronic health records, and lifestyle factors to provide personalized treatment recommendations and enhance disease diagnosis for individual patients.
Project Overview
The project consists of the following components:
Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset and perform initial data exploration. Handle missing values and encode categorical variables. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the DGM Model: Implement a deep generative model (DGM) using a library like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Train the DGM model on the training set to learn the joint probability distribution of glucose-insulin dynamics in patients with type 1 diabetes.
Generate Synthetic Data: Use the trained DGM model to generate synthetic patient data that mimics real-world dynamics. Validate the generated data by comparing it with the real-world data.
Integrate with Simulation Environment: Integrate the DGM model into a simulation environment with a state-of-the-art controller. Validate the generated data under different therapy settings.
Develop GEN AI Chatbot: Implement a GEN AI chatbot using a library like Rasa or Dialogflow. Train the chatbot using the generated synthetic data. Integrate the chatbot with the simulation environment to provide personalized medicine treatment plans.
