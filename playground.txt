Key improvements made:
    

Class-based Structure: Created an AIContentGenerator class to better organize the code and maintain state.

Single Responsibility: Each method has a clear, single responsibility.

Constant Definition: Moved the model name to a constant for easy modification.

Simplified Error Handling: More concise error handling with meaningful messages.

Reduced Nesting: Eliminated unnecessary nested try-catch blocks.

Better Null Checking: Used optional chaining (?.) for cleaner null checks.

Initialization Optimization: Combined initialization steps into the constructor.

Process Exit: Added process.exit(1) for proper error handling in production.
